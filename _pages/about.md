My name is Thomas Sweeney, and I am passionate about uncovering the stories that data can tell. My background in physics and astronomy has honed my computational, communication, and problem solving skills.  I am currently open to professional data science opportunities in the Boston area. 

# FAQ: 

## Q: Where can I see your work?

Please take a look at my selected works under the portfolio tab. For an in depth look please take a look at my github profile. 

## Q: Why move from physics to data science?

I am interested in moving into the data science field specifically. The reason for this is throughout my time in physics and astronomy, I fell in love with python, data visualization, and machine learning. What I love about physics is the process of taking a complicated problem and creating a mathematical model to solve that problem. What excites me so much about data science is the core problem solving is the same, but the problems are so impactful. My dream job is one that allows me to solve complicated problems with analytical methods and have the solutions I create influence the real world. 

## Q: What software tools are you most comfortable with?

I have a strong proficiecy in python. Some of my most used packages include numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, plotly dash, matplotlib, seaborn, and pytorch. My cloud platform of choice is Microsoft Azure. I also feel comfortable writing SQL queries, and using git for version control. Finally, I have a base familiarity with R, java, and html.
